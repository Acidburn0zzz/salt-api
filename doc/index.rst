salt-api
========

The ``salt-api`` project `has been merged`__ into the main Salt repository as
of Salt's **Helium** release.

.. __: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/13554

No api changes were made. The ``salt-api`` daemon remains intact and is
now available in the default ``salt-master`` install.

The documentation has been moved into the main salt project as well. ``netapi``
module documentation is available in the module index.

No further development will take place in this repository. It will be left in
the current state for historical purposes. Open issues will be migrated to the
Salt repository.
